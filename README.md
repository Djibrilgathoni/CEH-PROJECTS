# CEH Project: Network Scanning with Kali Linux (Fawn CTF)

## Overview
This project showcases my Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) skills, earned in August 2025, through a practical network scanning exercise using Kali Linux. I completed the Fawn machine on Hack The Box, applying tools like nmap to identify vulnerabilities, a skill directly applicable to IT support roles for securing and troubleshooting networks.

## Tools Used
- **Kali Linux**: Primary platform for ethical hacking tasks.
- **nmap**: For network scanning and port enumeration.
- **FTP**: For accessing and analyzing vulnerable services.

## Process
1. **Network Scanning**: Used `nmap -sC -sV <target-IP>` to identify open ports and services on the Fawn machine.
2. **Vulnerability Identification**: Discovered an FTP service vulnerability, allowing anonymous access.
3. **Exploitation**: Connected to the FTP server to retrieve the flag, simulating real-world security auditing.

## Key Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience with network diagnostics, critical for IT support tasks like troubleshooting connectivity issues.
- Strengthened ability to document technical processes clearly, a key skill for communicating with non-technical users.

## Relevance to IT Support
This project demonstrates my ability to use CEH skills to secure systems and diagnose network issues, enhancing my readiness for IT support roles where security and troubleshooting are critical.
